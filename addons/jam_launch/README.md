# Jam Launch Addon

This Godot 4 addon simplifies the deployment and hosting of multiplayer games.
It includes scripts for bootstrapping multiplayer games and an editor plugin
that facilitates deployment into the Jam Launch cloud.

Most features require a Jam Launch account. You can sign up for an account
[here](https://app.jamlaunch.com).

## Example project

There is an example project that uses this addon
[here](https://github.com/jam-launch/jam-launch-example).

## Deploy with a Jam Launch Credits

Jam Launch credits can be purchased and used to host your project on Jam Launch infrastructure. You only pay for the resources you use, and deployments can be
